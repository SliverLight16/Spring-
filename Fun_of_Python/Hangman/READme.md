Hangman: Key Concepts

JSON - a string document (text)  
 
Abstraction - hiding info from libraries and class to condense the code

File import - the list containing all the words is far to large to keep in the same file, so to optimize it's in a dif file and its import *sort of like library, instead of defining the function yourself in the same its done so elsewhere

methods (random.choice, string.ascii_uppercase, etc.) - random.choice gives us our word, string.ascii_uppercase forces all letters in alhpabet to be uppercase

while loops - while conditon keeps the game going. 

Nested Conditions - the if/elif/else conditional goes through all the possible outcome in the program and instructions on what to do is any were to happen

Lists - allows the computer to pick a random english word

User-defined functions: Void Functions vs. return - get_valid_word() return a word that the program use for hangman / hangman() executes the game but doesn't return data
