Guesss the Num: Key Concepts

Function - A block of code we can call on to use

Function Parameters - what needs to be inputed into function for function to run properly

Function Arguments - a variable that holds value within the function, usually outputted

random module (library) - a collection of functions that can be import to use in a program without having to explicitly define each special function.

while loop - it continues to loop until condition is meet.

boolean (data Type) - true or false helps program be more interactive and assist user

indentation - determines if any code in within any functions or conditions

Conditionals (if/else if) -  tells user if guess was too high or too low

Abstraction - im not quite sure, adstract data from the library
