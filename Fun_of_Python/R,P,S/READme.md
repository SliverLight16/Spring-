Rock, Paper Scissors:  Key Concepts

Variables -  tracks wins, the user's input, computer's pick(random), holds a string

Lists - it allowed the conditional statement to check if multiple 'values' are true or false in one instance

Boolean Logic (AND, OR, etc.) - creates a conditonal statement where one of many needs to be true or if multiple 'values' need to be true

While Loops - allows the user to play as long they wish 

Conditional (if/else if/ else) - determine if input was valid and if someone(or something) won

Optimization (clean code up and add functions) - the options string list allowed the progarmer to condense the code which would allow easier debuging.  Additonally, I added protection aganist ties
