Password Manager: Key Concepts

Pull data from files (open file) - we create files to store strings and uses another to encrypt it / fer.decrypt and open() lets us see it

While Loops -  we can add and view accounts|passwords as long as we wait

Conditional (if/else if/ else) - i think it allows us to open th file correctly 

Optimization (clean code up and add functions) - we only need to use the add_key func once , afterwards we commented it out.
